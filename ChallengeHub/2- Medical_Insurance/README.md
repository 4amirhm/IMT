# Medical Insurance Expenses & Premium Prediction Challenge

## Overview

This challenge focuses on analyzing and predicting insurance expenses and premium amounts using demographic and health-related attributes. The dataset contains +1300 records with information such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, discount eligibility, region, expenses, and premium amounts.

Participants are encouraged to:

- Explore the relationships between customer attributes and insurance costs.
- Build regression models to predict `expenses` or `premium`. (Two Targets!)
- Analyze the key drivers of higher insurance expenses.
- Evaluate and compare different machine learning techniques.

## Challenge Tasks

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Summarize the distribution of each feature.
   - Visualize correlations between attributes and the target variable.
   - Identify any outliers or unusual patterns.

2. **Prediction Model**
   - Choose one target variable:
     - `expenses`: The actual cost incurred by policyholders.
     - `premium`: The insurance premium charged.
   - Build and train regression models 
   - Assess model performance with metrics such as RÂ² and RMSE.

3. **Feature Importance**
   - Determine which features contribute most to predictions.
   - Discuss any potential data leakage (e.g., using `expenses` to predict `premium`).

4. **Reporting**
   - Submit a clear notebook including:
     - Data exploration
     - Modeling approach
     - Results and interpretation
     - Suggestions for business impact
     - Completely markdown
