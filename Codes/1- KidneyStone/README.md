# ðŸ§® Codes â€“ Kidney Stone Detection Project

This folder contains all scripts and notebooks related to the classification and detection of kidney stones in ultrasound images.

## ðŸ§  What to Submit Here

Participants should add:

- **Image Classification Models**
  - Models to distinguish Normal vs. Stone.
  - Training pipelines, evaluation scripts, and visualization code.

- **Object Detection Models**
  - Code for detecting and localizing kidney stones within images.
  - Annotation processing scripts.
  - Inference examples with bounding boxes drawn on test images.

- **Data Preprocessing and Augmentation**
  - Scripts to resize, normalize, or augment the dataset.

- **Utilities**
  - Helper scripts (e.g., converting annotation formats).
